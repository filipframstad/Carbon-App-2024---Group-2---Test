# Carbon-App-2024-Group-2

# Guide:

1. The Launch App branch is used as the "main" branch, where we merge "smaller" branches in to the main. This is connected to the AWS, and we rarely make changes in this file...

2. The file which we use to merge branches in to, as we further devlop the app, is the "Develop-App" Branch. This is not connected to the AWS. And therefore we can make changes here as we move on..." 

3. Further on we have the branches; "Home", "Methodology" and "Carbon Calculator". We will use these branches to develop different parts of the app, and therefore make sure that we dont overwrite someone elses work, and etc..

4. If you want to be sure that you dont overwrite something, or that youÂ´re not able to save your changes, you can make a separate branch from the home, methodology or carbon calculator, upload your files there and then make a pull request :)
